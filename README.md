# odin_recipes
M y first project in foundation called recipes.

this is a little fun project to build out a 
recipes websites. I learnt a lot about Git
and Github as I commit often. usually after 
creating a page and link it to 
index.html. I got practice on trying to write 
good commit comments. although I feel thereis much 
left to be desired on that part. I will continue to 
improve on this as I get more practice.

I also got to put into practice all i have learnt
 in the foundations thus far, like ,paragraphs, 
 alternative text, boilerplates, images, links, headings,
 ordered and unordered lists.

 I am enjoying the journey and I look forward to more
 challenges ahead.
